# Plan: QR Code Attendance System

A local Django-based attendance system with QR scanning, teacher photo uploads, and substitute teacher assignment.

## TL;DR

Build a Django web application on an Ubuntu server. A separate scanning PC with USB QR scanner sends batch check-ins to the server via WiFi. Three interfaces: Admin Portal (full control, reports), Teacher Portal (daily student table + history + photo upload), Scan Station (batch scanning page). One-month timeline is achievable.

## Phases & Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-5)

1. **Project setup** — Django project, PostgreSQL, environment config, Git repo
2. **User authentication** — Django auth with role-based permissions (admin/teacher)
3. **Core models** — Student, Teacher, StudentTeacherLink, migrations
4. **Admin seeding** — Management command to create initial admin user
5. **Basic templates** — Base layout, login page, dashboard skeleton

*Deliverable: Login works, database ready*

### Phase 2: Scan Station (Days 6-10)

6. **Scan page UI** — Full-screen page with:
   - Large textarea for accumulating scanned codes
   - "Submit Batch" button (or Enter key)
   - Results panel showing processed records
   - Clear button for next batch
7. **Batch processing endpoint** — POST endpoint that:
   - Receives list of scanned IDs (newline-separated)
    - For each ID: identify student/teacher, create StudentAttendanceRecord or TeacherAttendanceRecord if not exists today
   - Return detailed results per ID (success, already scanned, not found)
8. **Results display** — Show after batch submit:
   - ✓ "Ahmed Mohamed - Checked in at 8:15 AM"
   - ⚠ "Sara Ali - Already checked in at 7:45 AM"  
   - ✗ "Unknown code: ABC123"
9. **Sound feedback** — Success sound for batch complete, error beep if any failures
10. **Scan history panel** — Show today's total check-ins, last few successful scans

*Deliverable: Functional batch check-in station*

### Phase 3: Admin Portal (Days 11-17)

11. **Dashboard home** — Today's attendance summary (students: X/2000, teachers: X/200)
12. **Student management** — CRUD, bulk import from Excel, search/filter
13. **Teacher management** — CRUD, link to User account
14. **Student-Teacher linking UI** — Multi-select interface to assign students to teachers (many-to-many)
15. **All students browser** — Searchable/filterable table of ALL students
    - Click student → full attendance history with photos (same as teacher view but for ALL students)
16. **Attendance records view** — Filterable table (date range, teacher, student, grade)
17. **Excel export** — Download filtered records as .xlsx
18. **QR code generation** — Generate QR codes (just code, no fancy design), bulk PDF export (configurable cards per page: 8, 10, 12)
19. **Teacher absence handling UI** — Mark teacher absent, assign substitute to their students' records for the day

*Deliverable: Full admin functionality*

### Phase 4: Teacher Portal (Days 18-23)

19. **Teacher dashboard** — Today's summary (X of Y students attended)
20. **Daily student table** — Shows ALL linked students with columns:
    - Student name
    - Status (✓ Attended / ✗ Absent)
    - Check-in time (if attended)
    - Photo status (uploaded / not uploaded)
    - Action: Upload photo button
21. **Student history page** — Click student name → full attendance history:
    - List of all attendance records (date, check-in time, assigned teacher)
    - Photos displayed inline for each day (if uploaded)
    - Scrollable, most recent first
22. **Photo upload flow** — 
    - Mobile-optimized camera capture or file upload
    - Confirm before replacing existing photo
    - Compress images (max 1MB)
23. **Absent teacher indicator** — On student records where teacher was substituted:
    - Red banner: "Original teacher [X] was absent"
    - Shows substitute teacher name

*Deliverable: Teacher can view all students, see history, upload photos*

## Verification Steps

1. **Batch scan flow** — Scan 5 test QR codes, press Enter, verify all records created
2. **Duplicate in batch** — Include same QR twice in batch, verify appropriate warnings
3. **Same-day duplicate** — Scan student who already checked in, verify "already scanned" message
4. **Teacher daily table** — Login as teacher, verify ALL students shown (attended + absent)
5. **Student history (teacher)** — Click student → see full history with photos
6. **Student history (admin)** — Same feature but accessible for ANY student
7. **Excel export** — Filter records by date range, export, verify data integrity
8. **QR PDF generation** — Generate PDF with 10 student cards (simple QR codes), verify scannable
9. **Photo upload mobile** — Upload from phone browser, verify saved and linked to correct day
10. **Photo replacement** — Upload second photo same student/day, verify confirmation prompt
11. **Substitute assignment** — Mark teacher absent, reassign student, verify red indicator appears
12. **Cross-device access** — Access from multiple devices simultaneously

### Test Coverage Targets

13. **Unit tests pass** — Run `pytest` with all tests passing
14. **Coverage report** — `pytest --cov` shows >80% coverage
15. **Model tests** — All model methods and constraints tested
16. **View tests** — All endpoints return correct status codes and data
17. **Permission tests** — Verify teachers can't access admin routes and vice versa

### Documentation Verification

18. **Deployment doc test** — Follow `docs/deployment.md` on fresh Ubuntu, system runs
19. **Admin guide review** — Non-technical person can follow admin guide
20. **Teacher guide review** — Teacher can follow guide on mobile phone

- Student history view with photos (for teachers: their students; for admins: all students)
- Student-teacher many-to-many links
- Substitute teacher assignment per attendance record
- Simple QR card PDF generation (just QR code, no fancy design)
- Local-only deployment
- Single scanning station

**Explicitly Excluded:**
- Late arrival tracking (just check-in time recorded)
- Professional ID card design (just QR codes)
- Student self-service portal
- Automated notifications (email/SMS)
- Cloud backup sync
- Multi-campus support
- Multiple scan stations

**Technical Decisions:**
- PostgreSQL over SQLite for concurrent access at scale
- HTMX over React/Vue for faster development
- USB scanner on separate PC, connects via WiFi to server
- Local media storage

---

## Suggested Improvements (Optional, Post-MVP)

1. **Attendance reports** — Weekly/monthly PDF summary per teacher
2. **Audit log** — Track who made changes to records
3. **Data retention policy** — Auto-archive records older than X years
4. **Backup automation** — Scheduled daily backups with retention

---

## Hardware Requirements

**Ubuntu Server PC:**
- CPU: Any modern dual-core
- RAM: 8GB minimum (16GB preferred)
- Storage: 256GB SSD (photos will grow ~50GB/year at full usage)
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

**Scanning PC:** 
- Any laptop/PC with browser (can be old hardware)
- Connected to same WiFi/LAN as server

**USB QR Scanner:** 
- Netum NT-1228BL or similar (~$25-35)
- Plug-and-play, acts as keyboard
- Scans into any text field

---

## Timeline Risk Assessment

**Tight areas:**
- Teacher portal photo upload (mobile browser quirks)
- PDF generation styling
- Testing at scale

**Mitigations:**
- Start with simple photo upload, polish later
- Use proven PDF libraries
- Generate test data early

**If behind schedule:** Deprioritize teacher photo feature, add in week 5.
